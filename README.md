# magento2_module_structure
basic module structure of Magento 2

This is a basic module of hello world with layouts and templates (also can use for quick start for creating a module )

here,

cname - vendor name (company name eg: facebook )

mname - module name (relevant to what page we create eg: homepage )

the important thing to remember : 

1. creating module , register , routes , controller files .
2. the url can be called as follows : 
     
      http://magento.loc/trail/Index/Display

3.here my base url or my local host is "magento.loc" and the next thing which comes after that is unique route word "trail"
  which we mention in our routes file , next is the folder name "index" which is present inside the controller , next is the 
  controller name itself "Display".
